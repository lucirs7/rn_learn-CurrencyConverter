# Currency converter

App that converts rupees (India's currency) to other currencies such as American dollar, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Euro, Yen, Pound, or Dinhar (Morocco's currency).

It consists of a single screen with a text that shows result from conversion. Underneath this text there is a text input component that allows user enter desired rupees value to be converted. Below, there are several buttons in column disposition, each corresponding to the different currencies included in the app.

App was developed using react native and Expo but then ejected so it also has native modules for both Android and iOS.

### Future to-do's
---
- Let user choose currency to be converted from.
- Let user add custom currency.
- Search an API that gets current conversion values so app is always up to date.
